Building
========
To build op, the best option is to override the default Makefile settings
with ones appropriate for your system (the alternative is to edit the Makefile, 
uncommenting the appropriate sections).

op requires Flex (it will not work with standard Lex due to internal 
limitations on data structures in Lex).

Compiler flags are put into OPTS (this is a legacy setting), libraries in LIBS  
and link flags in LDFLAGS.

Build for typical PAM enabled Linux system:
  make OPTS='-DXAUTH=\"/usr/X11R6/bin/xauth\" -DUSE_PAM' \
    LIBS='-lcrypt -lpam -lfl' LDFLAGS='-Wl,-z,now'

Build for typical Solaris system with PAM:
  make LEX=flex OPTS='-DXAUTH=\"/usr/X/bin/xauth\" -DUSE_PAM' \
    LIBS='-lcrypt -lpam -lfl'

The available features are:

  Debugging:
    Compiler flags: -g -DDEBUG
    Link flags: -g

  PAM:
    Compiler flags: -DUSE_PAM
    Libraries: -lpam

  Shadow support:
    Compiler flags: -DUSE_SHADOW
    Libraries: -lshadow

  Use Flex:
    Libraries: -lfl

  XAuth support:
    Compiler flags: -DXAUTH=\"<full-path-to-xauth>\"

  If you have vsnprintf on your system:
    Compiler flags: -DHAVE_VSNPRINTF

Note: For SecureID support, read the Makefile and uncomment the appropriate 
section.

Installing
==========
"make install" will do a normal install. Optionally, DESTDIR can be used to 
install into a package root:

  make DESTDIR=/tmp/pkg install
