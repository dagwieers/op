Op is a tool for allowing users to run root privileged commands
without the root password. It is described in detail in "Op: A Flexible
Tool for Restricted Superuser Access" by Tom Christiansen. From this
description Dave Koblas produced an impementation of op in C. Tom's
original paper is included in this distribution in the file
"op.paper". Differences between that design and the current
implementation are noted in the file "op.changes".

Op has been in use at Octel since 1992. Over the years I've added a 
couple of things, and ported it to architectures we care about. These
now include SunOS 4.1.x, Solaris 2.2 and greater, AIX, HP-UX 9.x, 
BSDI 1.1 and Linux. I've added support for SecurID access control
from Security  Dynamics. This particular code has only been tested
under SunOS and Solaris. I also enhanced the syslog stuff so it will
log the command parameters that op executes as well as the command
name. Solaris shadow passwords are also supported. 


**** Disclaimer ****

This code has been extensively tested only on the Sun
architectures. We have noticed no egregious bugs on those platforms,
but that's no guarantee such bugs don't exist. That goes double for
the non-Sun architectures where testing has involved building,
installing and running "op sh" once or twice.

To build op, edit defs.h to point OP_ACCESS at the full pathname of
your op.access file. You can study the sample file included with the
distribution to get an idea of its semantics. Next, edit the Makefile
and remove comments from  the lines appropriate to your
architecture. 

 If you have the Security Dynamics ACE server software,
uncomment the lines pertaining to SECURID. Define SECURIDLIBDIR and
SECURIDINC to point at where the  sdiclient library, and the ACE
header files live respectively. The keyword "securid" in op.access
will enable the client code. Each host that runs op in this mode must
be configured as a client in the ACE server's database.

After that, a simple make in the source directory should build op. To
test op, the executable must be setuid root, and the op.access file
must reside at the place OP_ACCESS points to.

I'm grateful to Tom Christiansen and Dave Koblas for the original
design and implementation of op. I'm also grateful to all those folks
who, like Tom and Dave, have made my life easier by giving away
marvelous, useful source code. I'm happy to give a little bit back, at
long last.
