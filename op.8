.SH NAME
op \- operator access
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B op 
mnemonic [arg]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.I op
tool provides a flexible means for system administrators to grant
trusted users access to certain 
.B root
operations without having to give them full superuser privileges.
Different sets of users may access different operations, and the
security-related aspects of environment of each
operation can be carefully controlled.
.PP 
The fields of the entries in 
.I op.access 
are separated by white space.  Each entry may span several lines and
continues until the next alphanumeric string is found at the beginning of
a lines (which is taken to be the next
.I mnemonic,
and thus the beginning of a new entry).  Comments may be embedded
beginning with a # character.  Each entry in op
.I op.access
has the following form:
.RS
.DT
\fImnemonic	command \fR[\fI arg ... \fR]\fI ; \fR[\fI option ... \fR]
.RE
where the fields are interpreted in the following manner:
.TP
.I mnemonic
a unique, alphanumeric identifier for each operator function.
.TP
.I command
the full pathname of the executable to be run by
.I op
when the associated 
.I mnemonic
is chosen.
.TP
.I arg(s)
any arguments, either literal or variable, needed by 
.I command.
Literal arguments are simply specified directly, like specific command
options (\fB0Gun\fR) or files (\fB/dev/rmt20\fR).  Variable arguments
are specified here as \fB$1, $2 ... $\fR\fIn\fR; these are described
more fully in the options section below. \fB$*\fR indicates any number
trailing arguments.
.TP
.I option(s)
a set of optional parameters to specify settings or restoring for the
particular 
.I mnemonic,
define variable arguments specified for the 
.I command,
space and are of the form
.I keyword=value.
The absence of a specific list of values separated by commas, where
appropriate.
There should be no white space in each element of the 
.I value
string unless quoted.  The
.I keyword
is any of the following types:
.TP
.B uid
Set the user id to the value specified.  The value can be numeric user
ID or a login name.  The default is 
.B root.
.TP
.B gid
Set the group id's to the values specified.  Each value can be a numeric
group ID or a group name.
.TP
.B dir
Change the current working directory to the path specified.
.TP
.B chroot
Change the root directory to the path specified using 
.I chroot.
.TP
.B umask
Set the file creation umask to the octal value specified.  The default
is to set it to 
.B 022.
.TP
.B groups
Allow any user who belongs to a group listed here to execute this 
.I op
function.  The default is not to allow any specific group.
.TP
.B users
Allow any user listed here to execute this 
.I op 
function.  The default is not allow any specific users.  You may user
the regular expression .* to indicate that all users may use this
mnemonic.
.TP
.B password
Queries the user for a password, if there is no = part the
users own password is asked.
.TP
.B securid
Queries the user for SecureID PIN and code. If op has been compiled
without SecurID support, this option will cause the command to fail
with an error message.
.TP
.BI $VAR
where 
.I VAR
is the name of an environment variable.  The specified environment
case, simply using
.I $VAR with no = part (as in 
.B $USER)
means that this environment variable is inherited unchanged from
the caller's shell.
.TP
.B environment
Disables the destruction of the users environment.
.TP
.B $n
defines the \fIn\fRth variable argument specified in the command 
.I arg
list.  The value for this type may be a comma-separated list of regular
expressions using \fIegrep\fR(1).  option defines the range of values
allowed for the variable arguments  A variable argument specified as a
command 
.I arg
but not described in the 
.I options
section may take on any value.  If an argument does not match any
of its permitted values, then a diagnostic is printed and the
command is not executed.  When using '(' syntax to pass values
to other options, only the next options can use values from
the previous search.
.TP
.B $*
is used in the 
.I options
section to place restriction on the trailing arguments
specified as $* in the
.I args 
section.  If any of these (possibly many) arguments do not match, then
a diagnostic is printed, and the command is not executed.
.PP
There can also be a special entry in the file beginning at the first
non-comment line
that can define default values to override the builtin defaults listed
here, yet still be overridden by any entry that wants to redefine any of
the keyword fields described above.  It should have the following format:
.RS
.DT
\fBDEFAULT\fR	\fIkeyword_option\fR
.RE
where \fIkeyword_option\fR is a \fIkeyword=value\fR string mentioned above
under \fIoptions\fR.
.PP
It should be noted that if any regular 
.I mnemonic
entry defines its own
.I option,
the value given for that entry must explicitly include the item from the
DEFAULT line if the default values is to be included.  That is, the 
.I options
definitions completely override any
defaults; they do not add to them  In this way, if a value specified on
the DEFAULT line for 
.B users
or
.B groups
(for example) needs to be "erased" without redefining new values
(that is, we want no users or groups to be allowed to run the mnemonic),
then the default value must be overridden with nothing (as in
\fBusers=\fR).  For the
.B users
or
.B groups
fields, such a null setting has the effect of setting the list of
allowable users or groups to be empty.  For the other keywords (\fR
uid, gid, dir, chroot, \fRand\fB umask\fR), a null setting leaves that
attribute as it is upon invocation of the 
.I op
program, overriding any defaults.
.PP
Another note is that if the 
.I command 
for a 
.I mnemonic
is 
.B MAGIC_SHELL
then a shell (using the users $SHELL environment variable) is created, 
if there are arguments in addition to the 
.I mnemonic
on the command line then the shell is invoked "-c args".
